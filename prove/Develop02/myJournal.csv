Thank God that's working. as my new entry I want to write a bit more to see if I have some type of short limit, and how it saves to my csv file. What worries me is the fact that I use commas in this paragraph. Well I will continue checking other sections of my program now. Thank you.
1/20/2024 12:05:55 PM: my other entry is just to see if it saves to additional lines in myJournal file.
1/20/2024 12:07:16 PM: ohh I see to save my entry as an additional line I have to load the file first and then write other wise it will replace the file with new entry.
